I have here four files containing information on automobiles. 

  cheap.tsv, middle.tsv, upper.tsv, expensive.tsv

The files on autos are tab_separated_values (each field separated from the next
with a tab character. Each record is terminated with a newline. The fields are
in the order

ATID
Stock No.
VIN
Status
Make
Year
MSRP
Price
Body Style
Doors
Engine
Fuel Type
Exterior Color
Interior Color
Mileage
Stereo
Drive Type
Transmission

As far as I know, they all have an ATID and a VIN. Beyond that I am not sure.
You might want to look at them and see what the data is. For instance, Status is
"used", "new", "certified used". But I do not guarantee that those three are the
only values. 


And three files containing information on people.  

  staff.tsv, salesmaen.tsv, customers.tsv. 

The files on people are tab_separated_values (each field separated from the next
with a tab character). Each record is terminated with a newline. The fields are
in the order 

  Name, Address, City, State, Zip, Phone (home), Phone (work), Phone (cell)

As far as I know, everyone has a home phone. Some have work phones and some have
cell phones and some both. The phone numbers are fake as are the addresses. The
names are probably real people but I do not know who they are. The addresses may
be real, but I assure you they do not match the people. 

I did want to run the risk of someone thinking I am giving away 'real'
information.  BUT that does not mean that you are not to assume that these people
have all that kind of information or will have. And don't forget, you have to
plan on things (data sets) growing not only in numbers (more customers) but in
types of information that might be needed.  Plan for it. Put it in place.

If you have a serious question on the types of information that might be needed
or the tables and relationships that might need to be allowed for, ask.



Have fun.
